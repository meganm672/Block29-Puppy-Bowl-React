# Puppy Bowl React Requirements

User can see a list of each player competing in the bowl</br>

The user can click a details button (or something similar) on each puppy that will lead them to another page view with specific details on that puppy, such as owner and team name.</br>

Users can search for a specific player in a search bar and see a new list of players with names matching the text in the search bar.</br>

Somewhere in the application, there is a form to create a new player and it gets added to the all players list without refreshing the page</br>
